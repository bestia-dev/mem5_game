Now put all the smartphones on the table near to each other, \

The first player invites the others and chooses a kind of game visuals: \
alphabet, animal, playing cards,...  \
Other players can then accept the invitation.  \
If there are some communication sync issues, \
reload the webpage simultaneously on all smartphones. \
Just pool the screen down slightly and let go when the reload circle is visible. \
Player1 will see how many players have accepted. Then he starts the game. \
On the screen under the grid are clear instructions which player plays and which waits. \
The green color calls for player action, the red means wait and the orange is informational. \
Player1 flips over two cards with two clicks. This cards can be on any smartphone. \
The cards are accompanied by sounds and text on the screen. \
If the cards do not match, the next player will click on 'Click here to Take your turn'. \
The cards are than flipped back face down. \
Then it is his turn and he clicks to flip over his two cards. \
If the cards match, they are left face up permanently and the player receives a point. \
He continues to play, he opens the next two cards. \
The game is over when all the cards are permanently face up.
Good luck and enjoy !";
